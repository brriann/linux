### History

August 1991 - comp.os.minix post
March 1994 - Linux kernal Version 1.0 

Open vs Closed Source

1985 - GNU Manifesto
GNU's Not UNIX - opensource development of Linux

### OS Concepts
###

Kernel - hardware interface, memory allocation, CPU time allocation, program interop

abstract hardware
allocate resources to processes / manage resources
system critical processes vs processes requested by users (OS-level vs user-level)
user interface

# Process management
- create/delete/suspend/resume/synchronize/deadlock handling
-process states:
-- new, running, blocked/waiting, ready, terminated
-sychronization of concurrent processes
-- sharing of resources and data
-- management of CPU time (fairness, policy, efficiency, response time, turnaround time, throughput)
-- PID process identifier

Main memory management
- which processes are loaded into memory?
- allocate/deallocate memory

File management
- create/delete files/directories
- primitives to support files/directions
- map files onto secondary storage
- back up of files on stable storage

I/O system management
- read/write to hard disk. device driver handles specific device

Secondary storage management
- partitions, external storage
- manage/allocate storage space
- schedule requests for memory access

Command interpreter system
- aka, shells
- get and execute user specified commands

### Linux OS Structure
###

Kernel - core of OS. controls CPU process scheduling

System Call Interface SCI
Process Management PM
Virtual File System VFS 
Memory Management MM
Network Stack
Arch
Device Drivers DD

Shell - command interpreter, brings Kernel instructions

BASH - Bourne Again SHell ** most popular
C Shell - C lang features
KORN - expanded Bourne shell

X Windows - GUI service 
desktop env, window manager,  clients

GNU Network Object Model Environment GNOME
K Desktop Environment KDE

###
### Root User
###

root / superuser - has access to all commands and files on a *nix OS 

root directory - /
root users directory - /root 

/home/nonrootuser - other users home directory

root permissions - grant/revoke access permissions for other users

rootkit - intruder installed, "get root" 

root directory - filesystem tree, all branches off single directory

UNIX, multi-user design, stemming from terminal + mainframe 

UID - user identifer
root has UID = 0

echo $UID
cat /etc/passwd | less

fully empowered root user - DANGER

processes started by root user have root privileges

su, kdesu, sudo

SYSTEM DIRECTORIES, moving files/directories in and out
RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)

script -a outputFile.txt
